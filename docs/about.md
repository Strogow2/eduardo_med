Despite being born in Brazil, I am half Portuguese and have been living in Europe for the past 7 years. Most of that time I was studying at UvA, where I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees.

I ended up studying Finance, quantitative finance to be more specific. I was both a teaching and research assistant at some point, and was sure that I would end up following a career in academia. However, things didn't play out that way.

However, I never lost interest in research and learning new things, even after graduation. Hence, I came up with this page where  I aim to publish my research, projects, and ideas. I am interested in many things, so you can expect a little bit of everyting.

Hope you find something interesting!
